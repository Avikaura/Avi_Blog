Punjab, a northern state of India, covers an area of 50,362 square kilometers that is 1.53% of India’s total geographical area making it the 20th largest Indian state. Punjab, comprising of 22 districts, is the 16th largest state in India based on population inhabiting approximately 30,141,373 people. 

Punjabi, spoken widely by the local people, is the official language of the state. Being one of the most prosperous states of India, it gets its name from the five rivers – Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum. The word ‘Punjab’ is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Panchanada’ meaning ‘the land of five rivers’.

Punjab is divided into three regions by the five rivers – Majha, Doaba, and Malwa. It is benefited from all the natural resources like abundant water and fertile soil, which makes it a prime location for agriculture. Punjab shares its capital, Chandigarh, with its neighboring state Haryana.  [Click here to know more](https://www.theworldofpunjab.com/punjab-history/)
